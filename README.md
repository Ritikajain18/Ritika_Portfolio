# [Project 3:ðŸŽ¥ Movie Data Analytics](https://github.com/Ritikajain18/Data-Analysis-with-Movie-Data)

# Dataset:
The TMDb movie data (cleaned from original data on Kaggle). This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.

# Libraries:
All the codes are written on Jupyternotebook. The python libraries include numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn. Please make sure you have all these libraries installed.

# Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, we can conclude:

- The quantity and range of movie gets larger.We have more choices to choose from as an audience.
- We can not say high budget guarantees high popularity. But for movies with higher budgets do produce higher average popularity.
- To produce a more popular movie, the runtime should be best around 150 mins; Drama, Comedy, Action, these genres would be preferable.

# Limitations
Apart from the factors that makes the movies popular and successful, limitations should also be considered. There are some missing data and many erroreous zeros which may affect the analysis.

- It's hard for us to know how the vote_counts and popularity are measured.
- For foreign movies,currency is not indicated. Inflation over the years should also be taken into consideration.
